/// # Elrond smart contract module - Governance
///
/// This is a standard smart contract module, that when added to a smart contract offers governance features:
/// - proposing actions
/// - voting/downvoting a certain proposal
/// - after a voting period, either putting the action in a queue (if it reached quorum), or canceling
///
/// Voting is done through energy.
///
/// The module provides the following configurable parameters:  
/// - `minEnergyForPropose` - the minimum energy required for submitting a proposal
/// - `quorum` - the minimum number of (`votes` minus `downvotes`) at the end of voting period  
/// - `maxActionsPerProposal` - Maximum number of actions (transfers and/or smart contract calls) that a proposal may have  
/// - `votingDelayInBlocks` - Number of blocks to wait after a block is proposed before being able to vote/downvote that proposal
/// - `votingPeriodInBlocks` - Number of blocks the voting period lasts (voting delay does not count towards this)  
/// - `lockTimeAfterVotingEndsInBlocks` - Number of blocks to wait before a successful proposal can be executed  
///
/// The module also provides events for most actions that happen:
/// - `proposalCreated` - triggers when a proposal is created. Also provoides all the relevant information, like proposer, actions etc.  
/// - `voteCast` - user voted on a proposal  
/// - `downvoteCast` - user downvoted a proposal  
/// - `proposalCanceled`, `proposalQueued` and `proposalExecuted` - provides the ID of the specific proposal  
/// - `userDeposit` - a user deposited some tokens needed for a future payable action  
///
/// Please note that although the main contract can modify the module's storage directly, it is not recommended to do so,
/// as that defeats the whole purpose of having governance. These parameters should only be modified through actions.
